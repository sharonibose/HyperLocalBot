1. Inventory tracking: The store can easily keep track of orders and inventory, making it more efficient.

2. Time management: The store can inform customers about less busy times, increasing sales and distributing user traffic.

3. User-friendly interface: The items can be presented in a simple and presentable manner, making it easier for customers to use the bot with the help of buttons.

4. Feedback system: After delivering the products, the store can obtain feedback from customers to improve its services.

5. Telegram interface: The Telegram interface makes it easier to order.

6.Clickable options: The use of clickable options instead of typing reduces errors.

7. Offline store-like experience: It is easier to switch between inventory and see the shopping cart and its total, giving customers an offline store-like virtual experience.

8. Store timings: The store timings give the customer more information about when they can place an order.

9. "When to order" function: This function allows the customer to see the best time for offline shopping or when delivery can be the fastest.

10. Estimated time of arrival: The estimated time of arrival gives the customer an idea of how much time it will take before the order arrives.

11. Feedback and grievances: The customer can give their feedback to the store and request any additional items as well as address grievances if any.

Innovative business solutions and extra features that were implemented:

3. View inventory: The bot shows a clickable array of highest selling items available in the store along with its details and number of available pieces.

4. Simplified item addition: While viewing item details, the customer can either go back and see a list of all items, view items in the cart, or add multiple items to the cart simply by clicking on the command button.

5. Cart management: The bot allows customers to decide whether to go back to inventory to add more items or finalize the order and checkout while viewing the cart.

6. Estimated time of arrival: The bot displays the estimated time of arrival, giving customers an idea of when their order will arrive.

7. Feedback command button: The bot provides a feedback command button for customers to give feedback easily.

The bot has been designed to provide a better offline feel of virtual online shopping while helping the owner keep track of orders, efficiently deliver orders, and keep the inventory updated.
